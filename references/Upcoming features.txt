Things I want to add, ordered by priority:

on mobile, make the starfield glow slowly fade out when the touch stops

site tree for live/development versions of the site - dev version can be a sub-page (links to both in readme)

review and adjust star size diversity

real-time dynamically adjust viewport size

add a subtle smooth scroll-up effect upon initial load (desktop only)

Dark mode on site
  Make the entire view crack into peices, and then fall down revealing a light theme, maybe with a static grey image texture in the background (solid white for now). To return to dark mode, simply fade back into the stars.

Camera-move-to-POI feature: Use cameraTargetY (currently unused) to smoothly animate the camera to a selected POI when this feature is implemented.
