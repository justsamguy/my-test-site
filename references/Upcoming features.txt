Things I want to add:

Dark mode on site
  Make the entire view crack into peices, and then fall down revealing a light theme, maybe with a static grey image texture in the background (solid white for now). To return to dark mode, simply fade back into the stars.

Camera-move-to-POI feature: Use cameraTargetY (currently unused) to smoothly animate the camera to a selected POI when this feature is implemented.


Mobile features:
Site needs to resize in real-time
Footer needs to have a new layout (Text section first, links second).
make the star glow activate both on tap and on drag

review and adjust star size diversity


add a subtle smooth scroll-up effect upon initial load
